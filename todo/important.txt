important:
----------
-e2e betting tests
-jest unit tests
-non-realtime bets need to update instantly, but they're waiting until the next tick. Feature needs work. Consider removing, at least temporarily.
-when placing a bet, ensure wallet address from browser == stored address; if user is connected to wrong wallet, they can still place a bet
-bet form shows NaN if you type 0 then k, allows neg/dash to be typed
-move permanent operations to gcp
-contract verification
-Error: Request method eth_getBalance is not supported ---- when hitting place bet if wallet is connected, but not logged in I think
-in the same vein, !!!!!!!!
	Uncaught (in promise) Error: missing provider (argument="provider", value=undefined, code=INVALID_ARGUMENT, version=providers/5.7.2)

	When trying to place bet but in a browser without wallet. Need to prompt user to install metamask
-we are vulnerable to an attack where our wallet is drained to refund malicious players making a high volume of bets but not paying both sides, does that force us to pay the refund transaction fee? I think it does, need to test
	**idea: write function into smart contract that lets me ban player at the protocol level by id
		goes back to limiting number of bets per user per game. Contract and firebase need to be in sync
-the lobby needs to be able to limit the number of bets one player can have at a time or on one game
-we should add a check to see if payment systems are online somehow
-module upgrade
-messaging needs to support whitespace and newlines
-add help button to bet menu to report bet not being paid out
-repair cloud build, removed functions folder so cd in functions should be removed
-firestore database backup policy
-eval bar cypress test for on/off functionality
