# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As our product is not complete, you should not expect a secure app yet. We are only supporting the latest release currently.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you've found a vulnerability in the code, please please please open an issue and we'll respond within 24 hours. If all tests pass, you should expect any fixes to be merged up into test immediately. After the fix has been manually tested in the test branch for about a week, it will be in the next production release. The exception would be a vulnerability that puts users at risk, which would see a release ASAP.
