### Values

Values are subject to evolution and change, but it is paramount to establish a desired culture.

1. **Customer Obsession** - Amazon is famous for this. Without any customers, there's no business. Customers are simply the most important part of the equation. That means keeping our services clean and friendly. We will strive to deliver the best experience through customer service and a quality product.
2. **Code Standards** - Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin influenced this one. We promise never to release code whose behavior is not well tested. A bug will never knowingly make its way into production.
3. **Don't Be Evil** - Google used to say this, and we agree that businesses should not leave a negative impact. We will never implement anti-consumer mechanisms or knowingly cause harm.
4. **Treat Everyone with Respect and Dignity** - We will always be respectful internally and externally, even in the face of obscenity. That means customers, employees, and everyone else.
